PLAN

Most crucial:
- Maze creation.
- Shortest route movement system.
- Monster placement.
- Combat system.
- Stats display

Really crucial but not deathly crucial:
- Designs for everything in the game.
- Shop and potions/weapons/spells.
- Shrouded in darkness -> lit up maze.

Timeline: Guys, I am terrible at scheduling.
