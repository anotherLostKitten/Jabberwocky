PLAN

05/31

Most crucial:
- Maze creation. (Finished)
- Processing Display
- Monster placement. (Decided)
- Combat system.
- Stats display. (Player stats display finished)
- Inventory (?)
- Create different classes of monsters.
- Shortest route movement system. (Scrapped)

Really crucial but not deathly crucial:
- Designs for everything in the game.
- Room templates.
- Shop and potions/weapons/spells.
- Monster movement
- Magic

Very low priority:
- Mini map.
- Shrouded in darkness -> lit up maze. when explored
- Doors

Timeline: Each take at least one task to do over weekend

==============================

We established that we will create arrays of monsters that will be superimposed onto the dungeon array. We also scrapped the point and click navigating algorithm in favor of simply using arrow keys. We settled on the idea that each room will have a template geared towards fighting monsters and getting items. The rooms will have doors that may be unlocked when the monsters are defeated or when a key is found. We deleted the floor and wall class in favor of an integer array that will call another array for processing purposes. The display will be 15x15.
