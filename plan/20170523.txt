Timeline: Each take at least one task to do over weekend

==============================

We established that we will create arrays of monsters that will be superimposed onto the dungeon array. We also scrapped the point and click navigating algorithm in favor of simply using arrow keys. We settled on the idea that each room will have a template geared towards fighting monsters and getting items. The rooms will have doors that may be unlocked when the monsters are defeated or when a key is found. We deleted the floor and wall class in favor of an integer array that will call another array for processing purposes.
